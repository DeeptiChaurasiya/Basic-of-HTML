Question-01: Difference Between Structured Data and Unstructured Data

1. Structured Data

   >Structured data is well-organized and stored in a fixed format, usually in tables with rows and columns. It is easy to search, store, and analyze.
   >Examples:Student marks table
             Bank transaction records
             Employee database

   >Types of Structured Data

    Numeric data: Numbers (marks, salary, age)
    Text/categorical data: Names, gender, department
    Transactional data: Purchase bills, ATM withdrawals

2. Unstructured Data

   >Unstructured data is not organized in any fixed format. It does not fit into tables. It is harder to search and requires special tools to analyze.
   >Examples:Photos, videos, audio
             Emails, WhatsApp chats
             Social media posts (Instagram, Facebook)

   >Types of Unstructured Data

    Text data: Emails, messages, articles
    Image data: Photos, screenshots
    Audio/Video data: Songs, recordings, movies
    Social media data: Comments, posts, reels
